/**
 * CBE learning engine (batch 4): RLDDM-inspired online prior updating —
 * NOT RLDDM, and the name says so. The hand weights of `LINE_WEIGHTS` are
 * treated exactly as PRIORS; terminal outcomes (a claim ruled, an idea
 * failed) nudge them per action through share-form credit assignment.
 *
 * The engine is a PURE FOLD over the ledger: `evidenceModelAt(events)` =
 * fold(updateOnTerminal, initialModel, terminals) — learned, yet stateless
 * and fully re-derivable (constitution-compatible: L1 is never persisted
 * as fact). Cold start ≡ today's map: with no terminals the effective
 * values ARE the priors, exactly.
 *
 * Three declared, non-bridgeable differences from RLDDM (standing record):
 *  1. no reaction-time analog — the ledger has no RT;
 *  2. no trial-level joint likelihood — declared never (group-level
 *     likelihoods are not ours to pool);
 *  3. no cross-user pooling — one user, one ledger, one model.
 *
 * G0 status: synthetic ordering/sign recovery, null invariance, and
 * determinism are proven in `tests/cbe-engine.spec.ts` (SBC spirit:
 * recover known ground truth before touching real claims). The engine may
 * exist in the codebase but UNTIL G1 PASSES IT FEEDS NO UI — the profile
 * remote is read-only instrumentation, not product copy.
